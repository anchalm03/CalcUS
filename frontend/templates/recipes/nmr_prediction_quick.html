    <h3 class="title is-3">NMR Prediction (Quick)</h3>
    <h4 class="title is-4">Details</h4>
    <p>
        Relatively good and fast NMR predictions can be obtained by using <code>GFN2-xTB</code> for
        geometries (with xtb) and <code>PBEh-3c</code> for NMR predictions (with ORCA). For NMR
        predictions, the method used for the geometry does not have to match with the method used
        for the NMR prediction (unlike frequency calculations). In fact, it is common to optimize
        the geometries in a vacuum using a modest basis set (ex. <code>6-31+G(d,p)</code>) and
        predict the NMR shifts with solvation using a large basis set (ex.
        <code>6-311++G(d,p)</code>). The calculated NMR shifts do not correspond directly to the
        experimental shifts, but are linearly correlated to them. To obtain predicted shifts (in
        other words, shifts that should be close to the experimental shifts), the calculated values
        must be corrected using reference compounds. This could be done with a single compound (ex.
        TMS), but the fit will be better if several compounds are used. In addition to this, the
        slope between calculated shifts and experimental shifts may not be exactly $1.00$; having a
        range of reference compounds allows to correct this deviation. 

        <br>
        To benchmark this method, a
        set of 77 small organic molecules was used (<a
            href="http://cheshirenmr.info/MoleculeSets.htm"
            >Prepared by Lodewyk, Siebert, and Tantillo</a
        >.) Three of the compounds in the original set were ignored due to the importance of
        relativistic effects (which are not taken in consideration by the method.) These effect
        arise with heavy atoms, such as multiple chlorine atoms bound to the same carbon. This
        effect should be negligible for most molecules, although it is worth keeping in mind. As the
        experimental NMR chemical shifts were measured in chloroform, this solvent was used in both
        computational models. The shifts of equivalent atoms were averaged. Since the reference
        molecules are small and rigid, no conformational search was necessary. The final method is
        <code>PBEh-3c (SMD, CHCl3) // GFN2-xTB (GBSA, CHCl3)</code>

    <p>
        CalcUS will automatically apply the regression (if this exact method is used) and calculate
        the Boltzmann averaged chemical shifts. These results will be shown in the "Ensemble
        Properties" tab on the ensemble page. The chemical shifts of individual structures can be
        inspected below, in the "NMR" section.

    	<ol>
	    <li>
	        Optimize your structure with <code>GFN2-xTB</code> (default setting for xtb) and
	        solvation in chloroform (GBSA). If the molecule is flexible, perform a conformational
	        search with the same settings.
	    </li>
	     <li>
	        Perform an NMR prediction on the resulting ensemble using <code>PBEh-3c</code> with ORCA
	        and SMD solvation in chloroform. Specify the additional keyword <code>Def2/JK</code>.
	        You can filter the ensemble to perform the NMR prediction only on the most stable
	        conformers (above 0.01 or 0.02 of Boltzmann weight is a good rule of thumb.)
	    </li>
	    <li>If your compound has equivalent atoms, average their chemical shifts.</li>
